<h1>Introduction and Historical Importance</h1>

<p>Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, social reformers became increasingly concerned with an apparent rise in criminality, believing that this and other “undesirable” behaviors such as intemperance and sexual promiscuity posed a threat to the very order of society. Traditionally, the men and women who had been convicted of such offences were isolated from the wider community in jails and penitentiaries where they would no longer threaten society. (<a href="http://go.utlib.ca/cat/1149238">Ruemper</a>, p. 357) Advocates for penal reform, however, felt that this practice was ineffective as it did nothing to deter inmates from reoffending in the future. In fact, they found that many of those who had spent time in these traditional jails were incarcerated again afterwards, often on numerous occasions. They argued that instead of simply punishing convicts, the emphasis of the prison system should be on rehabilitation and prevention. This was especially true, they felt, of criminal women. In the eyes of the reformers, these ‘fallen women’ had been corrupted by external influences and no longer conformed to the Victorian ideal of the perfect woman. They believed, however, that a strict regimen of hard labor and spiritual education would allow those women who had been convicted of vagrancy, drunkenness and prostitution to return to this ideal and become productive members of society upon their release. (<a href="http://go.utlib.ca/cat/1149238">Ruemper</a>, p. 360-361) It was this line of thinking which led to the foundation of the Andrew Mercer Ontario Reformatory for Women.

This institution was to be presided over by a female superintendent who would act as a mother figure to the women incarcerated there and a female staff who could instill in the women a sense of morality which they were believed to lack. (<a href="http://go.utlib.ca/cat/1149238">Ruemper</a>, p. 359-360) The staff were to be strict in their enforcement of institutional rules but should also embody the characteristics of the ideal Victorian woman and impart these values to their charges. While imprisoned, women were to perform a variety of labors – mostly laundry and sewing – which were intended to teach them the skills required to secure ‘respectable’ employment, usually as domestic servants, upon release. They were also to engage in both religious and secular education for the duration of their sentence and were visited on a regular basis by a number of faith-based organizations. It, therefore, differed from older institutions where inmates were reputedly idle for much of their sentence. Prison authorities and social reformers alike hoped that this combination of education and labor along with the introduction of positive role models in the form of the prison staff would encourage women to abandon their criminal pasts and strive to become model Victorian women.

Over the past hundred years or so, Ontarian historians and legal scholars have focused their energies on discovering and analyzing patterns in the development of the provincial correctional system, often highlighting the pivotal role of the penal reform movement and its advocates. They have published extensively on the attitudes of government officials and the public during the late Victorian era as well as the evolving institutional policies and inmate profile which reflect these perspectives, often using pages of statistics to support their claims. But in the midst of all of these numbers and broad generalizations, it can be easy to forget that the inmates of these institutions were also people and that their stories can provide us with a greater insight into the Reformatory and the societal norms which it reflects than any page of statistics ever could. History is, after all, about people. Unfortunately, however, most of these stories lie hidden in the depths of the archives still waiting to be told.

While I acknowledge that bringing the stories of every prisoner to light would be a gargantuan – and, in all likelihood, impossible – task, I would like to create an online platform which would allow users to explore some of the stories of the women who were admitted to the Reformatory during its first year of operations, with the intention to expand the database in the future if time and resources permit. The initial phase of the project would cover the period from the day that the Reformatory officially opened its doors on the 28th of August 1880 to the 30th of September the following year. This end-date was chosen as it was the official end of the prison year, as used by the Inspector of Prisons and Public Charities in his annual reports. During these thirteen months, a grand total of 251 women were admitted to the Reformatory on charges which ranged from vagrancy and drunkenness to abduction and aggravated assault. (<a href="http://ao.minisisinc.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/ARCH_AUTHORITY/AUTH_DESC_DET_REP/SISN%204811?SESSIONSEARCH">Office of the Inspector</a>, p. 179-180) The women who were incarcerated during this period were seen as particularly problematic by the prison authorities. In a report issued at the end of the institution’s first full year, the Inspector expressed concerns that many of the women who had been admitted to the Reformatory were unlikely to be reformed due to their age or supposed innate criminal tendencies and that even those who did not fall into this category were unlikely to benefit from their incarceration unless the length of their sentences was greatly increased – a complaint which was echoed vociferously by the superintendent and which directly led to radical changes in sentencing practices across Southern Ontario.

Such a platform would serve two primary functions: the first being to facilitate easier access to the early records of the Andrew Mercer Ontario Reformatory for Females than is currently possible and the second being to allow users to explore these records within their historical context and gain a fuller understanding of the late-Victorian reformatory and the social norms which it reflects. The records of the prison are currently housed at the Archives of Ontario where some of the files can be viewed on microfilm. Most of the early files, however, are stored on microfilm reels which also contain records that are protected under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act despite not being covered by the legislation themselves. This means that it is difficult for researchers to access information about the women beyond what is included in the prison registers. Secondly, these early inmates were regarded as being particularly problematic by prison authorities and provided the impetus for structural changes across the province. Their experiences, therefore, highlight the human aspects of the prison system in a way that has been neglected in the past. Through these experiences we can begin to more fully understand the impact of imprisonment on the women as well as the norms to which they were expected to conform.</p>

<h1>Methodology and Timeframe</h1>

<p>In order to achieve this, I would first need to gain access to the detailed case files, containing information about the individuals and their time in the institution such as their backgrounds and habits. These files are now housed at the Archives of Ontario and, ideally, the project would be carried out under their auspices but, failing that, a Freedom of Information request would need to be made to access the files. As noted earlier, the files that would need to be accessed are not protected by the legislation but are stored with later files which are. The request should, therefore, be granted. As communicated to the applicant by a representative for the Archives by email, it could take up to 30 days for the request to be processed. During this time, research could be done on the history of the prison system and the Reformatory in particular in order to prepare an introductory section of the website. Once the request has been approved, a further six or seven months would likely need to be spent on researching the institution and its inmates and cross-referencing the case files against other records such as court and police files. This process would allow the researcher to develop the stories of the inmates beyond the basic information provided in the case files themselves. These other records are, however, largely accessible without any additional requests for information. When all of the information has been gathered it could be written up for publishing on the website in an additional month or two. While this research is being undertaken, the website would be in development so that the information could be uploaded as it becomes available. In addition to the exhibition of these women’s stories, the records being used would be digitized throughout the process and uploaded to a designated section of the website so that they would be easily accessed by other researchers in the future. This would be done simultaneously with the research process so that it would not add too much to the overall timeline. This would involve scanning the physical documents as well as those stored on microfilm using a traditional scanner or a microfilm scanner as appropriate. The project is, therefore, estimated to take approximately ten to twelve months to complete and the work could be carried out by two or three students with experience in computer science, history and archival studies.</p>
